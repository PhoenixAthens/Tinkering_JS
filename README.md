# JS ðŸ¤¨

_OUTDATED INFO AHEAD_

> This repository contains more than just some node applications!
> You'll find a bunch of directories in this project, the first one "Notes-App" is a node.js application that allows user to create notes from the command line. **It's currently a work in progress!**

_UPDATED INFO_

So I had some time to think things over! To better organize the project, I have decided to move the NodeJS Applications to their separate repos each. This repo will still be updated on a regular basis but will be more or so about JS and NodeJS and my attempts at getting a better understanding of these technologies.

## Sub-directories

The sub-directories illustrate my attempt at gaining a deeper understanding of JavaScript and Node in its entirety. You'll find examples from NodeJS's API documentation, from npm modules' API docs, and code-snippets from a bunch of NodeJS related courses (LinkedIN Learning, Udemy, etc.).

Here n There, In these sub-directories, you'll also find code snippets from Kyle Simpson's "You Don't Know JS" and a bunch of other sources.

P.S. My apologies for the messy project structure. Things will be improved overtime!ðŸ˜…
